# leafIRC

The awesome lightweight IRC client for your command-line.


## Why another IRC client?

This is not just another IRC client. It's not meant to replace your [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/), this is meant to be a powerful lightweight IRC client. The idea is to be lightweight and at the same time extremely powerful, for example it doesn't use [ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/), which means it won't give you that little window, instead you'll be able to check all your history just by scrolling your terminal logs.

This client is as command-line friendly as possible, instead of providing a "GUI in the command-line" (aka TUI) it makes you feel at home without dragging you to a different kind experience.


## What does it look like?

Everyone loves screenshots, so this is how it looks (keep in mind that it's still under heavy development):

## Any dependencies?

**Notifications (Optional)**

If you're under Mac OS X, leafIRC will use [Growl](http://growl.info/) to notify you about mentions and other stuff, so you'll need to have Growl installed and [gntp-send](https://github.com/mattn/gntp-send) which is the library we use to interface with Growl using C++.

If you're under Linux you'll need [libnotify](http://developer-next.gnome.org/libnotify/0.7/) for the notification system.

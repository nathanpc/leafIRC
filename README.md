# leafIRC

The awesome lightweight IRC client for your command-line.


# Why another IRC client?

This is not just another IRC client. It's not meant to replace your [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/), this is meant to be a powerful lightweight IRC client. The idea is to be lightweight and at the same time extremely powerful, for example it doesn't use [ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/), which means it won't give you that little window, instead you'll be able to check all your history just by scrolling your terminal logs.

This client is as command-line friendly as possible, instead of providing a "GUI in the command-line" (aka TUI) it makes you feel at home without dragging you to a different kind experience.


# How does it look like?

Everyone loves screenshots, so this is how it looks (keep in mind that it's still under heavy development):

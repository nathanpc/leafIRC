It's not meant to replace your [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/), this is meant to be a powerful lightweight IRC client. The idea is to be lightweight and at the same time extremely powerful, for example it doesn't use [ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/), which means it won't give you that little window, instead you'll be able to check all your history just by scrolling your terminal logs.\r\n\r\nThis client is as command-line friendly as possible, instead of providing a \"GUI in the command-line\" (aka TUI) it makes you feel at home without dragging you to a different kind experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does it look like?\r\n\r\nEveryone loves screenshots, so this is how it looks (keep in mind that it's still under heavy development):\r\n\r\n![leafIRC awesomeness](http://f.cl.ly/items/271S3g0q1h2k1I2T1K3a/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-15%20at%2012.39.33%20AM.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who's behind this?\r\n\r\nThese are the awesome developers behind this project:\r\n\r\n  * [Nathan Campos](http://about.me/nathanpc)\r\n  * [Chris Myers](vividexstance@hotmail.com)\r\n","name":"leafIRC","tagline":"The awesome lightweight IRC client for your command-line","google":"UA-37659971-1"}
